Case carwash

Your client needs you to create a system for controlling their car wash halls.

They wish to a more “smart” way of doing things, they wish for an app or something along the lines of an app, to make the process smarter, but they still want to keep a terminal, in case the app does not work, battery is dead or no reception ect…

 The client wants you to implement several features.

1. Write an app to control a car wash.
2. Minimum of 4 carwashes.
3. The code must make use of asymmetric programming (you need to be able to stop 1 car, while the other car wash halls are running).
4. You decide the GUI (WEB, WEB-app, WPF).
5. There must be a user system. Where users can log in and start the process from a terminal or a phone.
6. The user data need to be salted.
7. The user must be able to see their profile info.
8. You must use a NOSQL database (Firebase, Mongo DB).
9. The user can either have a subscription, to get free washes, or pay for one at the time.
